E.coli Obervational Project 

July 25, 2024

Project Description: 


General Protocol : Fecal swabs (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) and whole blood samples will be collected in vacutainer K2 EDTA (K2E) 10.8 mg tubes (BD, Sparks, MD, USA) from 20 farms, each farm with approximately 10 sick pigs and 5 healthy controls (2 swabs per pig, ~600 total swabs, ~300 blood samples). Samples will be collected by farm veterinarians and shipped to the university or dropped off at AHL. Upon sample arrival, one swab will be immediately frozen at -20Â°C as a backup, and the other will be used for E. coli culture and typing by PCR for virulence genes (fimbriae: F4, F18, F5, F6, F41; non-fimbrial adhesins: EAE, Paa, AIDA-I; and toxins: LT, STa, STb, EAST1, Stx1, Stx2). Pig DNA will be extracted from whole blood using the E.Z.N.A. Tissue DNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) to determine F4, F18, and CHCF1 susceptibility genotypes.
